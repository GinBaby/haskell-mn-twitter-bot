## Goal

We want a twitter account to let people know when meetups and other
information has been added to our website. Being the lazy programmers
that we are, this process can and should be automated.

This program should talk through @haskellmn to inform followers for
every new post with a short overview and link.


## Questions

 - How will twitter handle link shortening through API?
 - What API library do we want to use for twitter/atom
